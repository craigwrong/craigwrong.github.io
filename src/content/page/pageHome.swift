# Welcome, fellow Bitcoiner!

This is a blog about Bitcoin and Bitcoin-only. I write primarily about Bitcoin development but also about The Lightning Network and other Bitcoin-centric technologies. I will never – ever – write about shitcoins so you can go ahead and bookmark this home page with confidence.

Should you find anything of interest and would like to discuss just reach out to me on Twitter under handle [@notcraigwright](https://twitter.com/notcraigwright). Find out more about me [here](/about).
